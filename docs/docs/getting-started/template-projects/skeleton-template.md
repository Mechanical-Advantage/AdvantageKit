# Skeleton Template

The AdvantageKit skeleton template includes the basic code required to load AdvantageKit, but no subsystems or control logic. It is intended for teams who wish to design a complete project themselves without using a more complete template.

:::warning
The project is configured to save log files when running on a real robot. **A FAT32 formatted USB stick must be connected to one of the roboRIO USB ports to save log files.**
:::

We recommend that most users start with one of the other provided template projects:

- **[2025 KitBot Template](./kitbot-2025-template.md)**: For robots based on the 2025 FIRST KitBot.
- **[Differential Drive Template](./diff-drive-template.md)**: For other differential drive (tank) robots.
- **[Spark Swerve Template](./spark-swerve-template.md)**: For swerve drives primarily using the Spark Max and Spark Flex, including NEO, NEO Vortex, or NEO 550 motors.
- **[TalonFX Swerve Template](./talonfx-swerve-template.md)**: For swerve drives primarily using TalonFX-based motors like the Falcon 500, Kraken X60, and Kraken X44.
- **[Vision Template](./vision-template.md)**: Example code for running simple vision targeting and pose estimation.
