AdvantageKit is a logging, telemetry, and replay framework developed by [Team 6328](https://littletonrobotics.org). AdvantageKit enables **log replay**, where the full state of the robot code can be replayed in simulation based on a log file ([What is AdvantageKit?](https://docs.advantagekit.org/what-is-advantagekit/)). See also:

- [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope), our robot telemetry application which **does not require AdvantageKit to use**.
- [WPILib Data Logging](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/datalog.html), a simpler logging system included in WPILib (does not support log replay in simulation, but covers the needs of most teams).
