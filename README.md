## Repository Structure

### Logging

- [junction](/junction) - Primary component of logging, manages the flow of data between user code, WPILib, log files, network clients, etc. _Written in Java._
  - [junction/core](/junction/core) - Central system for managing data, including reading and writing from log files and user code.
  - [junction/shims](/junction/shims) - Replaces components of other libraries (WPILib) to interact directly with `junction`.
    - [junction/shims/wpilib](/junction/shims/wpilib) - Replaces WPILib components to read data from `junction` instead of the HAL.
  - [junction/autolog](/junction/autolog) - Annotation procesor for creating log input classes.
- [conduit](/conduit) - Transfers data between `junction` and the WPILib HAL efficiently. _Written in C++ and Java._

### General

- [build_tools](/build_tools) - Utilities to assist with building in Bazel and interfacing with WPILib and the roboRIO.
- [third_party](/third_party) - Tools for integrating third party libraries like WPILib.
